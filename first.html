     <p>I’m Rutuja Harde, a third-year Electronics and Computer Engineering student at Sanjivani COE. I’m currently diving into full-stack development and exploring how to combine coding with problem-solving. Alongside my studies, I’m working on a research paper focused on Driver Drowsiness Detection. I enjoy creative projects, especially in web design and graphics, which I’ve developed through various bootcamps.</p>
